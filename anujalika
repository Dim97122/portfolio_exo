Approach is not unique
Losing the opportunity of time that I have
Not going to be good enough
make fun of me
have of larger vision (not enough perspectives)
too slow with my approach to put it together
putting on wait
Not ideal lifestyle will pull me down
not being active enough
not being as caring as can be towards my family
missing moements of life with them
fear itself
